# Synthetic Testing Implementation

<ChallengeDifficulty :rating="3" />
<TimeEstimate time="2-3 days" />

## Executive Summary
This challenge addresses implementing synthetic testing to simulate user behavior and monitor system performance through automated checks.

## Problem Statement
Testing teams need to:
- Automate user journeys
- Monitor critical paths
- Verify performance
- Test across browsers
- Validate API endpoints

## Solution Approaches

### 1. Journey Automation
```typescript
interface UserJourney {
  name: string;
  steps: {
    action: string;
    validation: () => Promise<boolean>;
  }[];
  frequency: number;
}

class JourneyAutomation {
  async executeJourney(journey: UserJourney) {
    const results = [];
    for (const step of journey.steps) {
      const result = await this.executeStep(step);
      results.push(result);
    }
    return this.analyzeResults(results);
  }
}
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- Response time tracking
- Resource utilization
- Error rate monitoring

### 3. Cross-browser Testing
- Browser compatibility
- Visual consistency
- Feature parity

## Expert Tips
- Prioritize critical paths
- Monitor consistently
- Handle test data
- Maintain scripts
