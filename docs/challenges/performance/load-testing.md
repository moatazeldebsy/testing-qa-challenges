# Load Testing at Scale

<ChallengeDifficulty :rating="4" />
<TimeEstimate time="2-3 days" />

## Executive Summary
This challenge addresses the complexities of load testing large-scale distributed systems handling millions of concurrent users. Learn how to design and implement effective load testing strategies that accurately simulate real-world usage patterns.

## Problem Statement
A global e-commerce platform experiences significant performance degradation during peak shopping seasons. The system needs to handle:
- 2M+ concurrent users
- 50,000+ transactions per second
- Sub-second response times
- Multiple geographic regions

## Technical Context
The system architecture consists of:
- Load balancers
- API gateways
- Service mesh
- Microservices
- Database clusters
- Cache layers

## Impact Assessment
### Business Impact
- Revenue loss during peak times
- Customer trust erosion
- Competitive disadvantage

### Technical Impact
- System instability
- Resource exhaustion
- Cascading failures

## Solution Approaches

### 1. Distributed Load Testing with K6
```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export const options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 },
    { duration: '10m', target: 1000 },
    { duration: '5m', target: 0 },
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'],
  },
};

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('http://test.k6.io');
  check(res, { 'status was 200': (r) => r.status === 200 });
  sleep(1);
}
```

### 2. Cloud-based Load Testing
- Distributed test execution
- Geographic load distribution
- Real-time metrics collection
- Automatic scaling

### 3. Service-Level Load Testing
- Component isolation
- Bottleneck identification
- Resource monitoring
- Performance profiling

## Expert Tips
- Always start with baseline performance metrics
- Use realistic data patterns
- Monitor system resources during tests
- Implement proper test data management
