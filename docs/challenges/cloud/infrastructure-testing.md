<ChallengeDifficulty :rating="4" />
<TimeEstimate time="3-4 days" />

## Executive Summary
This challenge focuses on testing cloud infrastructure deployments, ensuring reliability, security, and compliance of cloud resources.

## Problem Statement
Organizations need to:
- Validate infrastructure as code
- Test cloud resource provisioning
- Verify security configurations
- Ensure compliance standards
- Monitor resource costs

## Solution Approaches

### 1. Infrastructure Testing Framework
```typescript
interface InfrastructureTest {
  resourceType: string;
  expectedConfig: Record<string, any>;
  validations: {
    type: 'security' | 'compliance' | 'performance';
    check: () => Promise<boolean>;
  }[];
}

class CloudInfrastructureTesting {
  async validateResources(tests: InfrastructureTest[]): Promise<{
    passed: boolean;
    violations: {
      resource: string;
      type: string;
      details: string;
    }[];
  }> {
    // Implementation
    return {
      passed: true,
      violations: []
    };
  }
}
```

### 2. Security Testing
- IAM policy validation
- Network security groups
- Encryption configuration
- Access controls

### 3. Compliance Testing
- Regulatory requirements
- Industry standards
- Company policies
- Resource tagging

## Expert Tips
- Use infrastructure as code
- Implement automated testing
- Regular security scans
- Cost monitoring
